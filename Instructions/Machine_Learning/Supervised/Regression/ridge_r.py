# Ridge Regression

Ridge Regression is a type of linear regression that includes a regularization term to prevent overfitting. It is particularly useful in cases where the model has a large number of predictors, or when multicollinearity (high correlation between predictors) is present.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Linear Regression

In linear regression, we model the relationship between a dependent variable $$( y )$$ and one or more independent variables $$( X )$$ using the equation:

$$ 
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \ldots + \beta_n X_n + \epsilon 
$$

Where:
- $$( \beta_0 )$$ is the intercept,
- $$( \beta_i )$$ are the coefficients,
- $$( \epsilon )$$ is the error term.

### 2. Overfitting

Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise in the training data instead of the underlying pattern, resulting in poor generalization to new data. Ridge Regression helps mitigate this issue.

### 3. Regularization

Ridge Regression adds a penalty term to the loss function used in linear regression. The modified loss function becomes:

$$ 
L(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{n} \beta_j^2 
$$

Where:
- $$( m )$$ is the number of observations,
- $$( \hat{y}_i )$$ is the predicted value for observation $$( i )$$,
- $$( \lambda )$$ is the regularization parameter,
- $$( \beta_j )$$ are the coefficients of the predictors.

### 4. The Effect of Lambda

- If $$( \lambda = 0 )$$, Ridge Regression becomes ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.
- If $$( \lambda )$$ is very large, the model may underfit the data, as it heavily penalizes the coefficients.
- A moderate value of $$( \lambda )$$ helps to balance bias and variance, leading to better generalization.

## Benefits of Ridge Regression

- **Handles Multicollinearity**: By adding the regularization term, Ridge Regression can handle correlated predictors effectively.
- **Improves Model Interpretability**: The regularization can lead to a more interpretable model by preventing extreme coefficients.
- **Robustness**: It provides a more robust model that performs better on unseen data.

## Implementation

Ridge Regression can be easily implemented in Python using libraries like `scikit-learn`. Here's an example:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Sample data
X = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y = np.random.rand(100)

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Ridge Regression
ridge_model = Ridge(alpha=1.0)  # alpha is the lambda parameter
ridge_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions
y_pred = ridge_model.predict(X_test)

# Performance
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
```


# Rigde Regression from scratch

### Explanation:

1.  **Initialization**: The `RidgeRegression` class is initialized with parameters for the learning rate, number of iterations, and the regularization parameter $$ \lambda $$.

2.  **Fitting the Model**:

    -   The `fit` method adds a bias term to the feature matrix and initializes the coefficients.
    -   In the gradient descent loop, the predicted values are computed, and the gradients are calculated, including the regularization term.
    -   The coefficients are updated using the calculated gradients.
3.  **Making Predictions**:

    -   The `predict` method adds the bias term and computes the predicted values based on the learned coefficients.
4.  **Example Usage**:

    -   A synthetic linear regression dataset is generated using `make_regression`.
    -   The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
    -   The model is fitted to the training data, predictions are made on the test data, and the Mean Squared Error (MSE) is calculated for evaluation.
