# Linear Regression

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The primary goal is to find a linear equation that best predicts the dependent variable based on the independent variables.

## Key Concepts

1. **Dependent Variable (Target)**: The variable we want to predict or explain (often denoted as \( Y \)).
2. **Independent Variable (Feature)**: The variable(s) used to make predictions (often denoted as \( X \)).
3. **Linear Relationship**: A relationship is considered linear if it can be represented by a straight line.

## The Linear Equation

The equation of a linear regression model is typically represented as:

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + ... + \beta_n X_n + \epsilon
$$

Where:
- $$( Y )$$ is the predicted value.
- $$( \beta_0 )$$ is the intercept (the value of $$( Y )$$ when all $$( X )$$ variables are 0).
- $$( \beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_n )$$ are the coefficients for each independent variable $$( X )$$.
- $$( \epsilon )$$ is the error term (the difference between the observed and predicted values).

## Types of Linear Regression

1. **Simple Linear Regression**: Involves one independent variable. The model is represented as:
   $$
   Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon
   $$

2. **Multiple Linear Regression**: Involves multiple independent variables. The model is represented as:
   $$
   Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + ... + \beta_n X_n + \epsilon
   $$

## Assumptions of Linear Regression

1. **Linearity**: The relationship between the independent and dependent variable is linear.
2. **Independence**: Observations are independent of each other.
3. **Homoscedasticity**: The residuals (errors) are equally distributed across all levels of the independent variable(s).
4. **Normality**: The residuals of the model are normally distributed.

## Model Evaluation

The performance of a linear regression model can be evaluated using several metrics:

- **R-squared ($$( R^2 )$$)**: Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. Values range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a better fit.
  
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: The average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.
  
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: The average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values. It penalizes larger errors more than MAE.
  
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: The square root of MSE, providing error in the same units as the dependent variable.

## Example of Linear Regression in Python

Here's a simple example using the `scikit-learn` library:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
data = {
    'X': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'Y': [1.5, 1.7, 3.2, 3.5, 5.1]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Split the data
X = df[['X']]
Y = df['Y']
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, Y_train)

# Predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Visualization
plt.scatter(X, Y, color='blue', label='Data Points')
plt.plot(X_test, predictions, color='red', label='Regression Line')
plt.title('Linear Regression Example')
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('Y')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

```
