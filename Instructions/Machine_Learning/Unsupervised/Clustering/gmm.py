# Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

## Introduction
A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is a probabilistic model that represents a distribution of data points as a mixture of multiple Gaussian distributions. GMMs are widely used in statistics, machine learning, and computer vision due to their flexibility in modeling complex data distributions.

## Key Concepts

### Gaussian Distribution
A Gaussian distribution, also known as a normal distribution, is defined by its mean (µ) and variance (σ²). The probability density function (PDF) of a Gaussian distribution is given by:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
$$

### Mixture Model
A mixture model is a probabilistic model that assumes that the data is generated from a mixture of several underlying probability distributions. In the case of GMMs, these distributions are Gaussian.

### GMM Representation
A GMM can be represented mathematically as:

$$
P(X) = \sum_{k=1}^{K} \pi_k \cdot \mathcal{N}(X | \mu_k, \Sigma_k)
$$

where:
- $$P(X)$$ is the overall probability density function.
- $$K$$ is the number of Gaussian components.
- $$(pi_k)$$ is the mixing coefficient for the k-th Gaussian component (with $$(\sum_{k=1}^{K} \pi_k = 1)$$).
- $$(\mathcal{N}(X | \mu_k, \Sigma_k)$$) is the PDF of the k-th Gaussian component, characterized by its mean $$(\mu_k)$$ and covariance matrix $$(\Sigma_k)$$.

## Expectation-Maximization (EM) Algorithm
The EM algorithm is commonly used to estimate the parameters of a GMM. It consists of two main steps:

1. **Expectation Step (E-Step)**: Calculate the expected value of the log-likelihood function, considering the current parameter estimates. This step computes the probability of each data point belonging to each Gaussian component.

2. **Maximization Step (M-Step)**: Update the parameters (means, covariances, and mixing coefficients) to maximize the expected log-likelihood computed in the E-step.

These steps are repeated iteratively until convergence, resulting in parameter estimates that best fit the data.

## Applications
GMMs have various applications, including:

- **Clustering**: GMMs can be used for soft clustering, where each data point can belong to multiple clusters with certain probabilities.
- **Anomaly Detection**: GMMs can help identify outliers in a dataset by modeling the normal distribution of data points.
- **Density Estimation**: GMMs can approximate the underlying probability distribution of complex datasets.


# GMM in Python
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture

# Generate synthetic data
np.random.seed(0)
n_samples = 300
# Create two clusters
cluster_1 = np.random.normal(loc=0.0, scale=1.0, size=(n_samples//2, 2))
cluster_2 = np.random.normal(loc=5.0, scale=1.0, size=(n_samples//2, 2))
X = np.vstack((cluster_1, cluster_2))

# Fit the Gaussian Mixture Model
gmm = GaussianMixture(n_components=2, covariance_type='full')
gmm.fit(X)

# Predict cluster memberships
labels = gmm.predict(X)

# Get the parameters
means = gmm.means_
covariances = gmm.covariances_

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=labels, s=40, cmap='viridis', marker='o', alpha=0.5)

# Plot the Gaussian components
for mean, covar in zip(means, covariances):
    # Create a grid for the contour plot
    x, y = np.mgrid[-3:8:.01, -3:8:.01]
    pos = np.dstack((x, y))
    rv = multivariate_normal(mean=mean, cov=covar)
    plt.contour(x, y, rv.pdf(pos), levels=5, cmap='Reds')

plt.title('Gaussian Mixture Model Clustering')
plt.xlabel('Feature 1')
plt.ylabel('Feature 2')
plt.axis('equal')
plt.show()

```

## Conclusion
Gaussian Mixture Models provide a powerful framework for modeling complex data distributions. Their flexibility and ability to capture multimodal distributions make them valuable in various fields such as machine learning, statistics, and computer vision.
