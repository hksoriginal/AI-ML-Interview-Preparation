# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Overview
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used for dimensionality reduction while preserving as much variance as possible. It transforms the original variables into a new set of variables, called principal components, which are orthogonal (uncorrelated) and capture the maximum variance in the data.

## Goals of PCA
- Reduce the dimensionality of the data.
- Retain the most important information.
- Help in data visualization.
- Improve computational efficiency for machine learning algorithms.

## How PCA Works
1. **Standardization**:
   - Standardize the dataset to have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1. This is important because PCA is sensitive to the scales of the variables.

   $$
   z = \frac{(x - \mu)}{\sigma}
   $$

   Where $$( \mu )$$ is the mean and $$( \sigma )$$ is the standard deviation.

2. **Covariance Matrix Computation**:
   - Compute the covariance matrix to understand how variables correlate with each other.

   $$
   Cov(X) = \frac{1}{n-1} (X - \mu)^T (X - \mu)
   $$

3. **Eigenvalue and Eigenvector Decomposition**:
   - Calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. Eigenvalues indicate the amount of variance captured by each principal component, while eigenvectors provide the direction of these components.

4. **Sort Eigenvalues**:
   - Sort the eigenvalues in descending order and choose the top $$( k )$$ eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors. The number $$( k )$$ is the number of principal components to retain.

5. **Form the Projection Matrix**:
   - Construct a projection matrix $$( W )$$ using the selected eigenvectors.

6. **Transform the Data**:
   - Finally, transform the original data into the new space by multiplying it with the projection matrix.

   $$
   Y = X \cdot W
   $$

   Where $$( Y )$$ is the transformed data.

## Visualization
PCA is often used for data visualization. By reducing data to 2 or 3 dimensions, it becomes easier to visualize and interpret the structure in the data.

## Applications of PCA
- Image compression.
- Genomics and bioinformatics.
- Noise reduction.
- Feature extraction for machine learning algorithms.

## Python Code Example

Here is how you can implement PCA using the `scikit-learn` library in Python:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

# Load dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

# Standardize the data
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
X_standardized = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X)

# Apply PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=2)  # Reduce to 2 dimensions
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_standardized)

# Visualize the PCA results
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.scatter(X_pca[:, 0], X_pca[:, 1], c=y, edgecolor='k', cmap='viridis')
plt.title('PCA of Iris Dataset')
plt.xlabel('Principal Component 1')
plt.ylabel('Principal Component 2')
plt.colorbar()
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```
